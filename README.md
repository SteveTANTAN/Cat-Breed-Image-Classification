# Cat-Breed-Image-Classification


• Based on Machine Learning, after comparing LeNet and AlexNet, using a modified residual network with 18 layers
(ResNet-18) as a selected network structure, which is trained without any pre-trained weights as ResNet has great
performance and is easier to train due to its residual structure.

• Used Adam as an optimizer and different data transform strategies, such as random rotation, random horizontal flip,
random vertical flip, random erasing, and color jitters, to achieve regularization of the model and overcome model
over-fitting.

• Achieved an accuracy rate of over 90 percent (top 5 percent in the course).
